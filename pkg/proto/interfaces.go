// Package proto houses all logic for processing protocol buffers into
// an easy-to-use structure for creating diagrams output. The intention is to
// support a verity of diagram types such as Mermaid and Plant UML.
// Since Go does not support logical libraries, these are loaded via direction
// implementations. ToMermaid() and ToPlantUML(). Please note, since this is
// a Go implementation, the Plant UML diagrams are syntax only, and the Java
// diagram compiler is not currently used.
